# Creating a Custom Connector

In this demo we'll prepare the ingredients to set up a custom connector for OpenMetadata.

The steps are:
1. We'll be following the following [doc](https://docs.open-metadata.org/sdk/python/build-connector/source#for-consumers-of-openmetadata-ingestion-to-define-custom-connectors-in-their-own-package-with-same-namespace)
on how to structure a Python namespace.
2. Then, we'll create our custom OpenMetadata Ingestion image on top of `openmetadata-ingestion`.
3. We'll test the connector from the UI.
